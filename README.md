# Plant Disease Detection Application
Created a Plant Disease Detection Web Application which captures images from the device camera and identifies the type of plant disease. At the backend server, I have created a Python program that keeps track of the captured image data and returns the output to the frontend using Tensorflow Keras Model, which was trained and tested using a Kaggle dataset giving 98\% accuracy. This Web project was developed and deployed on Github, having URL: [View App](https://akshat2512.github.io/octodollop/Plant_Health_App.html)
